# recipe-shoppinglist-generator

## Run
https://rawgit.com/crelder/recipe-shoppinglist-generator/master/index.html

## Solves two problems
1. I go shopping and do not know, which ingredients I should by - I always forget which recipes/meals I can cook.
2. I am at home and I want to cook a certain meal, but I do not have all the necessary ingredients.

## Input
Select the meals you want to cook.

## Output
Accumulated list with ingredients you need to buy in order to cook the selected meals.
The ingredient list is sorted by supermarket departments.

Workflow: Copy the shopping list into memories (Mac), Wunderlist or any other tool that helps you during your shopping trip.

Recipe explanations can be concise, because the contained recipes are your own recipes you know very well.

## Use your own recipes
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change the recipes.json file so that it fits your own recipes. Check [here](https://jsonlint.com.), if your recipes.json content has a valid json format.
2. Open the raw file of recipes.json in Github and generate a production link [here](https://rawgit.com/).
3. Copy that link into line 9 in the recipes.js file
3. Open the raw file of index.html in Github and generate a production link [here](https://rawgit.com/).
3. Bookmark this link and you can always generate your shoppinglist on the go. 

Done!
